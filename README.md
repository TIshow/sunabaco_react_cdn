# sunabaco_react_cdn

This is the react project for sunabaco GW lectures.
This react project does not use node.js instead, CDN is used. This is not official way to develop project with react however it would be nice for beginner to understand how react works.

if you use python, you can activate your local server by 
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5500
```
